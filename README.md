6.	Column 6 – Topic :

Topics are the various chronic diseases that have been reported from the above sources
i.	Alcohol – The people suffering from excess alcohol consumtion
ii.	Arthritis - Arthritis is inflammation of one or more of your joints. The main symptoms of arthritis are joint pain and stiffness, which typically worsen with age. The most common types of arthritis are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. 
iii.	Asthma - Asthma is a condition in which your airways narrow and swell and produce extra mucus. This can make breathing difficult and trigger coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath. For some people, asthma is a minor nuisance.
iv.	Cancer - Cancer is a group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body. These contrast with benign tumors, which do not spread.
v.	Cardiovascular disease  - Cardiovascular disease generally refers to conditions that involve narrowed or blocked blood vessels that can lead to aheart attack, chest pain (angina) or stroke. Other heartconditions, such as those that affect your heart's muscle, valves or rhythm, also are considered forms of heart disease. 
vi.	Chronic kidney disease  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) means your kidneysare damaged and can't filter blood the way they should. The main risk factors for developing kidney disease are diabetes, high blood pressure, heartdisease, and a family history of kidney failure.
vii.	Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema, is a chronic lung disease that makes it hard to breathe.
viii.	Diabetes - Diabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose comes from the foods you eat. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy. With type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin.
ix.	Disability - a physical or mental condition that limits a person's movements, senses, or activities.
x.	Immunization - Immunization, or immunisation, is the process by which an individual's immune system becomes fortified against an agent. 
xi.	Mental Health - Mental health means having good ways to deal with your feelings and how to enjoy life, even when things are hard. Having a healthy mind and body are both very important. Everyone has good days and bad days. A bad day doesn't mean you have a mental illness, but you can still improve your mental health.
xii.	Nutrition, physical activity, and weight status - nutrition, physical activity, and a healthy body weight are essential parts of a person's overall health and well-being. Together, these can help decrease a person's risk of developing serious health conditions, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and cancer.
xiii.	Oral health - Oral health is the health of your mouth, including your teeth, gums, throat, and the bones around the mouth.Oral health problems, such as gum disease, might be a sign that you have other health problems. Gum diseases are infections caused by plaque, which is a sticky film of bacteria that forms on your teeth.
xiv.	Overreaching conditions - . A condition of overreaching is common in athletes with an incidence ranging from 5% to 60%.1–7 However, overtraining syndrome (OTS) is much less prevalent.8,9 Overreaching is a state of excessive volume or intensity of exercise resulting in decreased sport-specific athletic performance.
xv.	Reproductive health - Good sexual and reproductive health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being in all matters relating to the reproductive system. It implies that people are able to have a satisfying and safe sex life, the capability to reproduce, and the freedom to decide if, when, and how often to do so.
xvi.	Tobacco – The excess consumption/ usage of Tabacco

9.	Column 9 – DataValueType – 
These are the metrices by which the DataValue has been provided
i.	Per capita alcohol consumption - Recorded alcohol per capita consumption of adults reflects the consumption of pure alcohol per person per country in a given year, and is computed from government records (taxation), industry publications for the production and sales of alcohol as well as data from the UN Food and Agricultural Organization
ii.	US Dollars
iii.	Age-adjusted Prevalence - A "standard" population distribution is used to adjust death and hospitalization rates. The age-adjusted rates are rates that would have existed if the population under study had the same age distribution as the "standard" population. Therefore, they are summary measures adjusted for differences in age distributions.
iv.	Crude Prevalence - A crude incidence rate is the number of new cancers of a specific site/type occurring in a specified population during a year, usually expressed as the number of cancers per 100,000 population at risk.
v.	Mean - The mean is the average of the numbers. It is easy to calculate: add up all the numbers, then divide by how many numbers there are. In other words it is the sum divided by the count.
vi.	Age-adjusted Mean - A "standard" population distribution is used to adjust death and hospitalization rates. The age-adjusted rates are rates that would have existed if the population under study had the same age distribution as the "standard" population. Therefore, they are summary measures adjusted for differences in age distributions.
vii.	Commercial host (dram shop) liability status for alcohol service - Commercial host liability is an evidence-based strategy to reduce excessive alcohol consumption and related harms. Commercial host (dram shop) liability laws hold an alcohol retailer responsible when a third party is injured or harmed (e.g., a death resulting from an alcohol-related car crash) by a patron to whom the retailer illegally served or sold alcohol (because the patron was visibly intoxicated or underage).
viii.	Local control of the regulation of alcohol outlet density - The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) define alcohol outlet density as the number and concentration of alcohol retailers (such as bars, restaurants, or liquor stores) in an area.1,4 The term alcohol outlets includes all commercial businesses that sell and serve alcohol, whether for consumption on or off the premises.
ix.	Number
x.	Age-adjusted Rate
xi.	Crude Rate - Crude Rates. Crude rates are quite simple and straightforward. They are calculated by dividing the total number of cases in a given time period by the total number of persons in the population.
